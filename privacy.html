                                                a newsletter or when we’re responding to your inquiries or requests. If you contact us, the record of your communication with the Server or the Platform staff may also be recorded so we can understand and
                                                solve the issues that you’ve reported. When you provide us with an e-mail address, we may use it to respond to your e-mails or inform you about changes to our Terms of Service. All other data you enter through
